**Project Overview<br>**
The DriverPass project was developed for a client called DriverPass, who needed an online learning platform to help individuals prepare for their driving tests. The system I designed provides users with instructional content, practice tests, progress tracking, and the ability to schedule driving lessons—all through an easy-to-use web interface.<br>

**What I Did Well<br>**
I focused on clearly capturing both the functional and nonfunctional requirements of the system. My documentation clearly outlines how users can register, log in, book appointments, and access online training. I also designed detailed UML diagrams (use case, class, and activity diagrams) to visually represent the system’s structure and processes, ensuring that every aspect of the user's journey is well considered.<br>

**Areas for Improvement<br>**
If I were to revise one part of my work, I would refine the UML diagrams to add further detail where necessary. For instance, I would include additional decision points in the login process to handle multiple failed attempts, which would enhance the security aspect. This improvement would make the diagrams even more robust and aligned with potential real-world challenges.<br>

**Interpreting User Needs<br>**
I carefully interpreted the user’s needs by reviewing the interview transcript and the business requirements document. I translated these requirements into a system design that supports account management, appointment scheduling, online training, and progress tracking. Considering the user's needs is crucial because it ensures the final product is user-friendly and addresses the real problems the client faces, which ultimately leads to higher user satisfaction and a more effective solution.<br>

**Approach to Software Design<br>**
I approach software design by first gathering detailed requirements from the client and then visualizing the system using UML diagrams. I rely on techniques such as creating use case diagrams to map out user interactions and class diagrams to define the system’s data structure. In the future, I plan to further incorporate iterative feedback and usability testing to refine the design and ensure it meets evolving user expectations.<br>
